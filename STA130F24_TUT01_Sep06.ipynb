ChatBots don't seem to be very aware of the contents of datasets that are avalable online (or even working url links where datasets are); so, ChatBot are not currently a substitue for exploring dataset repository such as [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) (or other data repositiory resources) and reviewing data yourself (although, ChatBot interactions can nonetheless be help with brainstorm dataset ideas and provide a way to \"search for content\", perhaps especially when referencing a specific website in the conversation)<br><br>\n",
